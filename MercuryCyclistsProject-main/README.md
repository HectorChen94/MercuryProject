Part B (due Tuesday 20th 11:55p.m Sydney time)
-------------------------------------------------------

All domains (procurement, inventory and sales) need to be built and implemented.

Use cases 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 can all be implemented via REST requests,
similar to how use cases 1, 2 and 3 were done in part A.

Use case 7 can be partially implemented via REST, but will
require messaging (apache kafka) for the rest of it.

For now, we need to figure out how we are going to organise/structure
the program according to the DDD (Domain-driven design) patterns.
